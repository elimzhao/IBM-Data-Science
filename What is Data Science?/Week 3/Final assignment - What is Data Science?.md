 # Final assigment - What is Data Science?



### Based on the videos and the reading material, how would you define a data scientist and data science?

Data science is the process of using the data that you have extracted, whether itâ€™s unstructured or structured in order to uncover insights and trends that you find in the data. Meanwhile, with the insights and trends that you have revealed, you translate this into a compelling story to the stake holders involved so that they can make relevant choices and strategy.

A data scientist is someone who finds solutions to a problem by analyzing data using the tools needed to communicate findings from that data to the relevant stakeholder involved. (S)he possesses important technical (computer science, software engineering, statistics) and soft skiils such as curiousity, critical thinkers who ask good questions and who are okay with managing unstructured situations while attempting to find structure in them.

Alternatively,

(After reviewing  the material I consider that data science is an interdisciplinary field that involves scientific methods, processes and systems to extract knowledge or a better understanding of data in its different forms, whether structured or unstructured,  which is a continuation of some fields of analysis of data such as statistics, data mining, machine learning and predictive analytics.

Additionally, I considert that  a data scientist is a new profession that today is considered key in the world of technologies. It is a person trained in mathematical sciences and statistics that dominates programming and its different languages, computer science and analytics.
The data science professional must also have the capacity and knowledge to communicate their findings as they have them, not only in the area of technology but also in the business sector. You must master the technology and databases to modify and improve the orientation of the business of the company for which you work.)

As discussed in the videos and the reading material, data science can be applied to problems across different industries. What industry are you passionate about and would like to pursue a data science career in?  You must master the technology and databases to modify and improve the orientation of the business of the company for which you work.

There are different applications for this field but i would be intereted in using it in the finance world. For example, you can use machine learning to predict the future value of a certain currency or you can program algorithms to automatically trade stocks.
